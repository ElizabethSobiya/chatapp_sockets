# chatapp_sockets

This is an chatapp completed using websockets. The github had 2 separate files one for frontend and other for backend. 
You need to install all the dependencies to run the project. The data like users and messages are connected to local mongoDB.
Connect the data to the local and start running the server.
Register 2 users and open tab for 2 users in the 2 separate tabs and you can sent the messages between 2 users.
Richeditor using draft.js was added for editor and because of some issues unable to link that with socket-app.
